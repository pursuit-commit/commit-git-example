# commit-git-example

Over the course of the Commit Program, we will expand on this library to practice REST API best practices, Data Modeling, Data Structures and Algorithms, Problem Solving, and more...

The goals of this project are to brainstorm and design solutions for Git functions. 

1. Managing Users and Commits
2. Managing a Commit history
3. (Future) Managing Multiple Branches
4. (Future) Merging Branches

### Part 1: Initial API
Using Django, Build an API and Database with 2 tables / models. See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial02/ for Django database setup documentation.

**Table 1: Users**
**Table 2: Commits**

Feel free to use the type interfaces defined in types.ts to guide your implementation of these tables. See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/models/ to guide the model code.

Once you have written your model files, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial02/#playing-with-the-api for directions on how to play with your API in the terminal (python shell).

### Part 2: URLs and Views
Now lets step back to the first step in the Django Tutorial, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/ -- pay attention to the views.py and urls.py files

Set up these views:

List of Users
List of Commits

### Part 3: Understanding Template Views
I would start this step by reading this documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/class-based-views/base/#templateview
